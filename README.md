# Welcome!
Hello there! Welcome to my profile. I am XeeZ, a *slightly* dumb person who wants to learn all I can. I have knowledge in simple programming, and I love configuring Source 1 games.

My simple knowledge includes:
- General Python3 Knowledge.
- Some minor networking.
- Source games stuff.

## Current Projects
None right now, **BUT** I do have some behind the scenes stuff I am working on.
